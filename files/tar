#-- Tar interception command. Suppresses annoying "SCHILY" messages when extracting a TAR archive originating from a MacOS system.
# This is primarily intended for Linux systems, but can be used for any system with GNU/Tar.
# This cuts down the amount of output echoed to your terminal or output log,
# and is expecially useful when extracting a tar file from MacOS with a lot of files.
