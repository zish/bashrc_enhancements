#-- Add a directory to PATH, but make sure it exists.
# - If it already exists, change location or remove it. Repeated entries are condensed as well.

#
# To use this, source the file from your .bashrc (or .bash_profile).
#
#-- Syntax examples:
# "addpath /usr/bin first"       - Adds "/usr/bin" to the beginning of PATH.
# "addpath /usr/local/sbin"      - Adds "/usr/local/sbin" to the end of PATH.
# "addpath /usr/local/sbin"      - Repeat of the previous to illustrate that duplicates do not get added.
# "addpath ${HOME}/foo first"    - Adds "foo" from your home directory (Ex. "/home/zish/foo") to the beginning of PATH.
# "addpath ${HOME}/bar remove"   - Removes any references to "${HOME}/bar" (Ex. "/home/zish/foo") from PATH.
#
#-- Results:
# - If the original value of PATH was "/bin:/usr/bin:/home/zish/bar"...
# ... and "/home/zish/foo" exists, the end result would be "/home/zish/foo:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin".
# ... and "/home/zish/foo" does not exist, the end result would be "/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin".
